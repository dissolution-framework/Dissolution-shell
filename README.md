**Detect hidden power shifts**

## Quick Start

The Dissolution Shell framework reveals institutional transformation through three analytical lenses:

1. **Surface** - What narratives are told or hidden?
2. **Guardian** - Which oversight systems are active or silent?
3. **Architecture** - What structural changes are occurring?

```
Event → Apply Three Lenses → Identify Convergence → Respond
```

## Why Use This Framework?

✓ **Detect early warning signs** of institutional drift  
✓ **Reveal coordinated changes** across systems  
✓ **Cut through surface narratives** to underlying structures  
✓ **Make sense of complex transformations**  

## Example Analysis

**Event**: New AI regulation proposals

**Surface**: "Safety first" messaging across all platforms  
**Guardian**: Oversight bodies delay implementation timelines  
**Architecture**: Regulatory authority consolidates under single office  

**→ Pattern**: Safety rhetoric masks power centralization

## Getting Started

### 1. Read the Framework
See [dissolution_shell_v03_licensed.md](dissolution_shell_v03_licensed.md) for the complete methodology with examples and templates.

### 2. Apply the Lenses
Choose any current event and systematically examine it through Surface, Guardian, and Architecture perspectives.

### 3. Look for Convergence
When all three lenses point in the same direction, you've found something significant.

*"The most powerful changes happen not when institutions announce them, but when they occur silently beneath surface rhetoric."*
